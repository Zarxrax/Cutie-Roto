Cutie Roto is a fork of [Cutie](https://github.com/hkchengrex/Cutie), and is designed to be a user friendly tool for AI assisted rotoscoping of video clips. It serves as a free alternative to commercial solutions such as Adobeâ€™s Roto Brush or DaVinci Resolve Magic Mask. It is generally less accurate than manual rotoscoping, but can usually give a pretty good result with little effort.
